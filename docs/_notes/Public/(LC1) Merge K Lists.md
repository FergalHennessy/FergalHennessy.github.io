## Merge K Lists
You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, where each linked list is sorted in ascending order.
*merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.*

#### Examples:
lists = \[\[1, 4, 5], \[1, 3, 4\], \[2, 6\]\] -->  \[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6\]
lists = \[\] --> \[\]
lists = \[\[\]\]
